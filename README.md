# Turning-Back-the-Clock
This project changes the last modified date of any file in Java.

It is a simple program written in Java, which accepts three command line arguments
1. A string of the form MM/DD/YYYY representing the new date
2. A string of the form HH:MM:SS representing 24-hour time in Eastern Standard Time
3. A string representing the name of a file in the current directory

In case any argument is missing or not in the above format, the code displays the exception message. <br/>
On executing the program, it displays the current last modified and updated last modified date of the file. The output is shown below.
